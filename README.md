# Job Roles and Requirements Analysis in Humanitarian and Development Organizations

This repository contains the analysis of job roles and requirements across various globally-focused humanitarian and development organizations using advanced topic modeling techniques. The primary method utilized is Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to discern the shared characteristics, skill requirements, and organizational priorities within these entities.

## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to identify pivotal trends in the demand for specific skills, the balance between technical and administrative roles, and the core values that underpin the missions of these organizations. This analysis is particularly relevant for stakeholders ranging from policy makers to educational institutions, offering a data-driven roadmap for aligning workforce training and recruitment strategies with the dynamic demands of the global job market.

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: This folder contains the datasets used for the analysis, including the job listings corpus.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with all the analysis steps, from data preprocessing to topic modeling and visualization.
- `results/`: Output from the topic modeling analysis, including tables, statistics, and visualizations.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of Python dependencies required to run the notebooks.

## Key Findings

- Topics that dominate the job market in the humanitarian and development sector.
- The evolving nature of skill requirements in response to global trends.
- Employer differences in job roles and how global trends are adapted to local contexts.

## Usage

To run the analysis notebooks, ensure that you have `Python 3.x` installed along with the libraries listed in `requirements.txt`. Install the dependencies using the following command:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
